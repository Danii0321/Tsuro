# Tsuro

This project is an implementation of the board game Tsuro. Our implementation of Tsuro will be with three to five players. Players have tiles with paths on them and the goal is to place the tiles so their token doesn't fall off the board (10x10 grid). Our service will be able to run tournaments with other client programs playing against each other.

## File Structure

```
../Tsuro/
└── Planning
```

Everything within the Tsuro directory will be related to running or playing the Tsuro game.

The `Planning` directory contains the initial `REAEDME` and project plan.
